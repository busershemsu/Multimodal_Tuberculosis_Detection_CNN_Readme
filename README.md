# Multimodal Tuberculosis Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis project on multimodal tuberculosis detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of tuberculosis detection by combining various modalities such as X-ray images and symptom data.

## Project Structure

## X-ray Image Preprocessing
The `x-ray_image_preprocessing` file includes preprocessing steps applied to the X-ray images before feeding them into the CNN.

## Lung Segmentation
The `lung_seg_xray_unet_model_saving` file contains the saved model for lung segmentation using U-Net.

- **Symptom**: Data and code related to symptom analysis.
- **X-ray Image**: Pre-processed and raw X-ray image data.
- **Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning scripts and results.
- **Early Fusion**: Implementation details for early fusion approach.
- **Joint Fusion**: Implementation details for joint fusion approach.
- **Late Fusion**: Implementation details for late fusion approach.

## Contact Information
The complete project is private to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the research data. However, the README is publicly accessible to provide an overview of the project.
